                            <p>There are a variety of tools and frameworks available to you when building a web
                                application. However, we believe Laravel is the best choice for building modern,
                                full-stack web applications.</p>
                            <h5><strong>#</strong>A Progressive Framework</h5>
                            <p>

                                We like to call Laravel a "progressive" framework. By that, we mean that Laravel grows
                                with you. If you're just taking your first steps into web development, Laravel's vast
                                library of documentation, guides, and video tutorials will help you learn the ropes
                                without becoming overwhelmed.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                If you're a senior developer, Laravel gives you robust tools for dependency injection,
                                unit testing, queues, real-time events, and more. Laravel is fine-tuned for building
                                professional web applications and ready to handle enterprise work loads.
                            </p>
                            <h5><strong>#</strong>A Scalable Framework</h5>
                            <p>
                                Laravel is incredibly scalable. Thanks to the scaling-friendly nature of PHP and
                                Laravel's built-in support for fast, distributed cache systems like Redis, horizontal
                                scaling with Laravel is a breeze. In fact, Laravel applications have been easily scaled
                                to handle hundreds of millions of requests per month.
                            </p>

                                Note that we donâ€™t provide utility classes for justified text. While, aesthetically,
                                justified text might look more appealing, it does make word-spacing more random and
                                therefore harder to read.

                                The most basic Laravel routes accept a URI and a closure, providing a very simple and
                                expressive method of defining routes and behavior without complicated routing
                                configuration files:
                            </p>

                            <code>
                                use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;
                                Route::get('/greeting', function () {
                                    return 'Hello World';
                                });
                            </code>
                            <h5><strong>#</strong>The Default Route Files</h5>
                            <p>
                                All Laravel routes are defined in your route files, which are located in the routes
                                directory. These files are automatically loaded by your application's
                                App\Providers\RouteServiceProvider. The routes/web.php file defines routes that are for
                                your
                                web interface. These routes are assigned the web middleware group, which provides
                                features
                                like session state and CSRF protection. The routes in routes/api.php are stateless and
                                are
                                assigned the api middleware group.

                                For most applications, you will begin by defining routes in your routes/web.php file.
                                The
                                routes defined in routes/web.php may be accessed by entering the defined route's URL in
                                your
                                browser. For example, you may access the following route by navigating to
                                http://example.com/user in your browser:

                            <p>
                                Middleware provide a convenient mechanism for inspecting and filtering HTTP requests
                                entering your application. For example, Laravel includes a middleware that verifies the
                                user
                                of your application is authenticated. If the user is not authenticated, the middleware
                                will
                                redirect the user to your application's login screen. However, if the user is
                                authenticated,
                                the middleware will allow the request to proceed further into the application.
                                <code>
                                    php artisan make:middleware EnsureTokenIsValid
                                </code>
                                Additional middleware can be written to perform a variety of tasks besides
                                authentication.
                                For example, a logging middleware might log all incoming requests to your application.
                                There
                                are several middleware included in the Laravel framework, including middleware for
                                authentication and CSRF protection. All of these middleware are located in the
                                app/Http/Middleware directory.
                            </p>
                            <code>
                                    namespace App\Http\Middleware;

                                Instead of defining all of your request handling logic as closures in your route files,
                                you may wish to organize this behavior using "controller" classes. Controllers can group
                                related request handling logic into a single class. For example, a UserController class
                                might handle all incoming requests related to users, including showing, creating,
                                updating, and deleting users. By default, controllers are stored in the
                                app/Http/Controllers directory.
                                Let's take a look at an example of a basic controller. Note that the controller extends the base controller class included with Laravel:
                            </p>
                            <code>
                                App\Http\Controllers\Controller:
                            </code>
                            <code>
                                namespace App\Http\Controllers;

                                    use App\Http\Controllers\Controller;
                                    use App\Models\User;

                                    class UserController extends Controller
                                    {
                                        /**
                                        * Show the profile for a given user.
                                        *
                                        * @param  int  $id
                                        * @return \Illuminate\View\View
                                        */
                                        public function show($id)
                                        {
                                            return view('user.profile', [
                                                'user' => User::findOrFail($id)
                                            ]);
                                        }
                                    }
                            </code>

                                Middleware provide a convenient mechanism for inspecting and filtering HTTP requests
                                entering your application. For example, Laravel includes a middleware that verifies the
                                user
                                of your application is authenticated. If the user is not authenticated, the middleware
                                will
                                redirect the user to your application's login screen. However, if the user is
                                authenticated,
                                the middleware will allow the request to proceed further into the application.

                                Additional middleware can be written to perform a variety of tasks besides
                                authentication.
                                For example, a logging middleware might log all incoming requests to your application.
                                There
                                are several middleware included in the Laravel framework, including middleware for
                                authentication and CSRF protection. All of these middleware are located in the
                                app/Http/Middleware directory.
